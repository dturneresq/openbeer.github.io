title: "New GitHub Org beer.csv - Beer Data in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) e.g. Wiener Original, 5.3%, 12.3Â°, Ottakringer, Vienna Lager"
---


Started (yet another) GitHub org, that is, [beer.csv](https://github.com/beercsv),
that collects beer data in the CSV (comma-separated values) format for
easy (re)use.

To get started added - for a change - [beer statistics](https://github.com/beercsv/statistics)
such as production, imports, exports, consumption, consumption per head,
etc. Example:

~~~
Country,2009 (l),2010 (l),2011 (l)
Austria,106.5,105.8,108.1
Belgium,81,78,78
...
~~~
