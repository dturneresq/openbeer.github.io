title: "Beer-A-Day - Open Data 'Eternal' Page-A-Day Calender - beer.db Web App Sample in Ruby on Rails"
---

As an example of using the beer.db - open public domain beer n
brewery data - added a page-a-day "eternal" calendar
serving a different beer every day. See a live demo with an
[all-Austrian taproom](http://at365.herokuapp.com)
[(Feed)](http://at365.herokuapp.com/feed) or
[build your own](https://github.com/beerkit/beer.db.day).
All code and data is public domain.  Cheers. Prost. Kampai.

PS: Added another live demo with an
[all-Belgian taproom](http://be365.herokuapp.com) [(Feed)](http://be365.herokuapp.com/feed)
and both calendars now offer a web feed with the ten latest beers of the day.
